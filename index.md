# About Me
I am a Norbert Wiener Assistant Professor at Tufts University. I was fortunate to have as a PhD advisor
<a href="https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/baccelli/" >Prof. Francois Baccelli</a> at the University of Texas at Austin.
My research is in probability, in particular in stochastic geometry and opinion dynamics. 

I did my undergraduate studies at MIT, where my advisor was <a href="http://math.mit.edu/~gigliola/">Gigliola Staffilani</a>.
